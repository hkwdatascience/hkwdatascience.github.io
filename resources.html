				<p>	Taking online courses is the best way for you to initiate your career in either
					computer science or data science. There is an plethora of helpful resources available 
					online to jump start your career. Here are some online courses that I took to help me start my career.

					<h3>Coursera</h3>
				<p>
					&emsp;Coursera is a very popular online educational platform. There are thousands of courses available online, and 
					you might find yourself lost within the immense selections. I have taken many courses here, and my 
					experience on this platform was fairly positive. Here is a list of the courses that I have taken.
		
					<ul>
						<li>Programming for Everyone(Getting Started with Python)
							<ul>&emsp;This course is taught by Professor Charles Severence from the University of Michigan. This course 
							provides a great foundation to the basic syntax and logics of coding with python. The class also 
							touch on python data structure and web scraping. However, this course only provides enough 
							content on basic applications. If you are interested in the mechanisms and the science behind coding, 
							you should seek out other resources too. </ul>
						</li> 
						<li>Web Development for Everyone
							<ul>&emsp;This online course is taught by Professor Colleen van Lent also from the University of Michigan.
								This specialization is a great resource for anyone interested in creating a website for themselves. 
								As a matter of fact, this page that you are reading right now is built on the knowledge covered 
								in the course. 
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Introduction to Git and Github</li>
							<ul>&emsp;A great and concise introduction to using git and github from the people at google. This is a 
								perfect starting point for anyone wanting to learn more about version control and collaboration.
							</ul>
						<li>Machine Learning Specialization</li>
							<ul>&ensp;Created by the founder of coursera, Andrew Ng, this specialization is arguably one of the best 
								starting point for people interested in machine learing and AI. I am currently in the process of 
								taking this course, and I will give it a full review after my completion. 
							</ul>
					</ul>
