			<p>
				&emsp;My name is Hongkai Wang, but you can also call me Bruce. I am an aspiring data scientist currently 
			pursuing a master degree in the field. My undergraduate majors were originally in Biochemistry and 
			Mathematics. My interests in data analystics were inspired by a bioinformatic project that I undertook 
			during a summer internship. This experience brought me into the world of computer science and data science, 
			and I was captivated every since.
			</p>

			<p>
				&emsp;Currently, I am looking to gain experience in the field and create interesting intepretation of 
				existing data sets. You can find personal passion projects and miscellaneous coding practices posted on
				this website.
