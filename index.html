		<p> This webpage illustrates my path to becoming a qualified data scientists. I started out with minimal experience in coding 
			and zero background in data science. It is my wish that this page can be the testimony of preserverance and help others who
			 wish to enter the wonderful world of modern data analytics.</p>
		<p> In these pages, you can find the data projects, educational 
			resources, and some personal insights. These resources have helped my greatly,
			and I wish they would be equally helpful to you as well. </p>
